#Servo Motor Control with Potentiometer (Arduino)

This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using a potentiometer connected to an Arduino.
By rotating the potentiometer, the servo angle changes smoothly between 0° and 180°.

How It Works

 - The potentiometer provides an analog input (0–1023) to the Arduino.
 - The Arduino reads the value and maps it to an angle range (0–180°).
 - The mapped value is sent to the servo motor, which rotates accordingly.
 - As you turn the potentiometer knob, the servo rotates in real time.
